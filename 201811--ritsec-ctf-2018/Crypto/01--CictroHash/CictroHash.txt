CictroHash
150
See the attached PDF for an amazing new Cryptographic Hash Function called CictroHash. For this challenge you must implement the described Hash Function and then find a collision of two strings. Once a collision is found send both strings to fun.ritsec.club:8003 as a HTTP POST request like below:

curl -X POST http://fun.ritsec.club:8003/checkCollision \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"str1": "{{INSERT_STR1}}", "str2": "{{INSERT_STR2}}"}'
If the strings are a valid collision then the flag will be returned.

NOTE: requests to this server are being rate-limited for obvious reasons.
